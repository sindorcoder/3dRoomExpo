## About the Project

The 3D Virtual Expo Project provides a realistic 3D visualization of
rooms and buildings, allowing users to explore the interior as if they
were physically inside the space. Users can freely walk through rooms,
view furniture, and experience the layout in an immersive virtual environment.

This project is especially valuable for construction, real estate,
and expo companies, as it enables them to present buildings that are still
under construction with high-quality 3D visuals.
